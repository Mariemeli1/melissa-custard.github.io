/**
 * VARIABLES:
 * 
 * 0.Variables are containers for storing data values that can be changed later on.
 * Variables are how programmers give a name to a value so that we can reuse it, update it or simply keep track of it.
 * 1. To create a variable we can use the keywords var, let or const.
 * 2. You need to give a variable a name, names are case sensitive and can contain a letter or these 2 symbols $ or _
 * they can also contain numbers but they cannot start with a number.
 * 3. There are 2 things that need to take place in order to use a variable: Declaration and assignment/initialization.
 */


// 1. Declaration //
// To declare a variable you need the var keyword and the name of the variable
var favColor;
console.log(favColor); //-----> Prints out undefined because the var hasn't been assigned to any value.

// 2. Assignment/Initialization //
// Assigning a variable means giving the variable a value using an equal sign.
var favColor = 'pink';
console.log(favColor); //-----> Prints pink because that is the value assigned to the variable favColor.

//3. var/let/const //
//var
